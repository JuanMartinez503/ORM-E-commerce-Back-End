# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description
- My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database. I received the starter code from Xandromus on Github. The code uses Javascript and it runs in the backend.
